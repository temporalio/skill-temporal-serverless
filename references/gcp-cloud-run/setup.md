# GCP Cloud Run — Setup (happy path)

End-to-end: write a standard Worker, containerize it, push the image, create a Worker Pool at zero instances, grant Temporal permission to scale it, register a Worker Deployment Version, set it current, verify. For the two service accounts and the Terraform module, see `iam.md`. For what the execution model does and does not bound, see `constraints.md`. For new builds and rollback, see `versioning.md`. If it doesn't work, see `diagnostics.md`.

## Prerequisites

- **Cloud Run — Public Preview.** Available to all Temporal Cloud customers. There is no access request, support ticket, or manual toggle to enable; select GCP Cloud Run as the compute provider and proceed with the deployment.
- A Temporal Cloud account with a **GCP-hosted Namespace**, or self-hosted Temporal Service v1.31.0+. The Namespace must be hosted on GCP; its region need not match the pool's.
- For self-hosted, complete `self-hosted.md` first.
- Every Workflow must declare a versioning behavior, or the Worker must set a default.
- A GCP project with billing enabled and permission to enable service APIs and create Worker Pools, Artifact Registry repositories, Cloud Build jobs, service accounts, and Secret Manager secrets.
- `gcloud` CLI and `jq` installed; authenticate `gcloud` before the preflight. The Google Cloud console or Terraform also work.
- **Terraform** installed — Temporal ships the IAM setup as a Terraform module.
- A Temporal SDK supported by this skill: Go, Python, TypeScript, Java, or .NET.
- Two Temporal Cloud API keys that can access the target Namespace, one for each consumer. The **Worker's key** lives only in the Secret Manager runtime secret. The **operator's key** lives only in the operator's Temporal CLI profile. Both need the Namespace's Write permission, because polling Task Queues and changing Worker Deployment routing are both Write operations. Separate keys therefore do not reduce privilege; they let each key be rotated or revoked without breaking the other. **The user creates both keys**, either in the Temporal Cloud UI under **Settings → API Keys** or by running `tcld apikey create --name <NAME> --duration <DURATION>` in their own terminal. Never run `tcld apikey create` from the agent's shell: it prints the new key. The command creates a key for the current user; add `--service-account-id <ID>` to create it for an existing service account instead. For a shared or long-lived Worker, give the Worker's key to a service account scoped to this Namespace, which an account administrator creates with `tcld service-account create-scoped --name <NAME> --namespace-permission "<NAMESPACE>=Write"`, and let the operator use their own key. For a personal test, the user may enter one short-lived user key in both [hand-offs](#hand-off-the-temporal-api-keys); say that rotating or revoking it then breaks both.

<!-- docs/production-deployment/worker-deployments/serverless-workers/cloud-run/index.mdx:36-51 -->

The `temporal` CLI commands in Steps 6–8 authenticate through a named CLI profile that holds the operator's key, written by the [operator hand-off](#hand-off-the-temporal-api-keys) or reused from an earlier deployment. An exported variable in the user's terminal does not reach the agent's shell, so do not rely on `TEMPORAL_API_KEY` there. Never append `--api-key <value>` or put the key in an inline assignment. On macOS the default profile file is `~/Library/Application Support/temporalio/temporal.toml`. The examples below pass `--profile <PROFILE>` explicitly; omit it only when using a different already-configured authentication mechanism, including self-hosted mTLS.

**Use the endpoint Temporal Cloud shows for the Namespace.** Copy the gRPC endpoint from the Namespace page in the Cloud UI, or from `tcld namespace get --namespace <NAMESPACE>` when `tcld` is signed in: `.uri.grpc` is the Namespace endpoint and `.uri.regionalGrpc` the regional API endpoint. Both accept API-key authentication; prefer `.uri.grpc` unless the user already uses the regional one. Do not construct it from the Namespace name or region. Use the same value, written `<ENDPOINT>` below, for the CLI profile and for the pool's `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`.

## Prepare a clean GCP project

After the resource list is approved, create only what is missing. First enable every API used by the commands below:

```bash
gcloud services enable \
  run.googleapis.com \
  artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  secretmanager.googleapis.com \
  iam.googleapis.com \
  iamcredentials.googleapis.com \
  cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
  --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>
```

Create a regional Docker repository for the Worker image:

```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories create <REPOSITORY> \
  --repository-format docker \
  --location <REGION> \
  --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> \
  --description "Temporal Serverless Worker images"
```

Create the runner service account that pool instances use:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create <RUNNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID> \
  --display-name "Temporal Cloud Run Worker runner" \
  --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>
```

Create the Secret Manager secret before deploying the pool. This creates only the secret; the Worker's key is added during the hand-off below:

```bash
gcloud secrets create <SECRET_NAME> \
  --replication-policy automatic \
  --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>
```

### Hand off the Temporal API keys

There are two hand-offs, and each reads one key. The **Worker hand-off** adds the Worker's key to the secret. The **operator hand-off** writes the operator's key to the CLI profile. Skip the operator hand-off when the operator already has a profile that authenticates to this Namespace; see [Reuse what already works](#reuse-what-already-works).

The user runs each script after the resource list is approved and the secret exists, **in their own interactive terminal**. Do not run either through the agent's shell or a `!`-prefixed command: `read -s` needs a terminal, and the key would pass through the agent's session. Steps 1–3 and Step 5's Terraform need no key and can continue meanwhile. **Step 4 waits for the Worker hand-off:** the pool deploy fails until the secret has an `ENABLED` version. **Step 6 waits for the operator's profile.**

Worker hand-off:

```bash
(
  if [ ! -t 0 ]; then
    printf 'Run this in an interactive terminal; nothing was changed\n' >&2; exit 1
  fi
  printf 'Worker API key: ' >&2
  IFS= read -r -s key
  printf '\nlen=%s\n' "${#key}" >&2
  dots=${key//[^.]/}
  if [ "${#dots}" -ne 2 ]; then
    printf 'Expected a JWT-shaped key with two dots; nothing was changed\n' >&2; exit 1
  fi
  printf %s "$key" | gcloud secrets versions add <SECRET_NAME> \
    --data-file=- --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>
)
```

Operator hand-off:

```bash
(
  if [ ! -t 0 ]; then
    printf 'Run this in an interactive terminal; nothing was changed\n' >&2; exit 1
  fi
  printf 'Operator API key: ' >&2
  IFS= read -r -s key
  printf '\nlen=%s\n' "${#key}" >&2
  dots=${key//[^.]/}
  if [ "${#dots}" -ne 2 ]; then
    printf 'Expected a JWT-shaped key with two dots; nothing was changed\n' >&2; exit 1
  fi
  temporal --profile <PROFILE> config set --prop address --value "<ENDPOINT>" &&
  temporal --profile <PROFILE> config set --prop namespace --value "<NAMESPACE>" &&
  temporal --profile <PROFILE> config set --prop api_key --value "$key"
)
```

The parentheses run each script in a subshell, so the key does not stay in the user's shell afterwards. The Worker's key is piped with `printf %s` because `gcloud` stores standard input byte for byte: pasting it, pressing Enter, and sending EOF would store a trailing newline and corrupt the credential. `temporal config set` has no standard-input option, so the operator's key is briefly visible in the process list while that command runs; on a shared machine, say so before the user runs it.

**Make the hand-offs impossible to miss; they are the same for every SDK.** Write each script to its own file outside the app directory and outside any repository, with every placeholder filled in, such as `<WORK_DIR>/<PREFIX>-worker-key.sh` and `<WORK_DIR>/<PREFIX>-operator-profile.sh`. Neither contains a key. Then end your turn with the user's action first:

1. One line saying the run is waiting on them.
2. Each file's absolute path as plain text, Worker hand-off first, and the one command to run it in their own terminal: `bash <ABSOLUTE_PATH>`. Say which key each one asks for.
3. What to reply when they finish.

Put status, checklists, and notes after that. Never point back to "the script above": whenever the run is still blocked on a hand-off, repeat these steps in full. When the user replies, verify with the commands below rather than trusting the reply.

Then verify without reading either key back. The agent may run these:

```bash
temporal --profile <PROFILE> config get --prop address
temporal --profile <PROFILE> config get --prop namespace
temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment list --namespace <NAMESPACE>
gcloud secrets versions list <SECRET_NAME> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> \
  --format='table(name,state,createTime)'
```

Never read back `api_key` with `temporal config get`, and never run `gcloud secrets versions access`. The `worker deployment list` call proves the profile authenticates to the Namespace. Expect exactly one `ENABLED` secret version. If the Worker hand-off ran more than once, keep the newest version and disable the older ones as described in [Rotate the Temporal API keys](#rotate-the-temporal-api-keys). Secret versions are immutable: replace a bad one by adding a correct version, never by editing it.

**Check the Temporal-side names now.** A new profile did not exist at approval time, so this can be the first point at which the deployment name can be checked:

```bash
temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment describe --namespace <NAMESPACE> --name <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
```

It should report that the deployment does not exist. If it exists, stop and agree a new name with the user before Step 6.

#### Reuse what already works

**An existing CLI profile.** If the operator already has a profile for this Namespace, for example from an earlier deployment, skip the operator hand-off, but only after the user confirms that the profile's key is not also stored in a secret. A profile written together with a secret from a single key shares that key with every pool that mounts the secret, so rotating or revoking it breaks them. If the user cannot confirm, run the operator hand-off with a new key; you must not read either value to compare them. Confirm the profile with the read-back commands above, always passing `--namespace`: a profile's stored Namespace can differ from the target.

**An existing secret.** Reuse a secret only when the user confirms that it holds a key meant for Workers; you must not read it. Do not reuse a secret that holds the operator's own key, such as one written together with a CLI profile from a single key: rotating or revoking that key would break both. Run the Worker hand-off into a new secret instead. Confirm a reused secret has an `ENABLED` version with `gcloud secrets versions list`, and record it as shared, so teardown keeps it.

Grant only the runner access to that secret. First check whether it already has access, and record the answer in the inventory: teardown removes only a binding this deployment added. This prints the member and exits `0` when the binding already exists:

```bash
gcloud secrets get-iam-policy <SECRET_NAME> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> --format=json \
  | jq -e '.bindings[]? | select(.role == "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor")
           | .members[] | select(. == "serviceAccount:<RUNNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>@<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>.iam.gserviceaccount.com")'
```

Then grant it; the grant is idempotent, so it is safe either way:

```bash
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding <SECRET_NAME> \
  --member="serviceAccount:<RUNNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>@<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor \
  --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>
```

This grant is a secret-store write that the agent's environment may block; if it does, give the user the command to run in their own terminal. Before each create, use the corresponding `describe` command from `iam.md` to avoid colliding with shared resources. The invoker service account is created later by Temporal's Terraform module; do not substitute it for the runner.

## Step 1: Write Worker code

**There is no Cloud Run Worker package.** Write an ordinary long-lived Worker — same client, same `Worker`/`WorkerFactory`, same registration — and add Worker Versioning, which Serverless Workers require.

Two things the Worker must do:

1. **Declare its Worker Deployment Version and enable versioning**, with a deployment name and build ID that exactly match the version you register in Step 6.
2. **Read its configuration from the environment** — address, Namespace, Task Queue, credentials — so one image can run against any Namespace. The pool supplies these via `--set-env-vars` and `--set-secrets`.

**The entrypoint must start the Worker process**, so an instance begins polling as soon as it starts. <!-- docs/production-deployment/worker-deployments/serverless-workers/cloud-run/index.mdx:465-468 -->

## Step 2: Containerize the Worker

Follow the selected SDK's Cloud Run guidance for the container image, runtime, entrypoint, certificate requirements, and memory settings.

The basic path uses one Worker container. If the user asks for OpenTelemetry export to Google Cloud, use the multi-container Worker Pool manifest and Collector sidecar described in `observability.md` instead of trying to add the sidecar with this file's single-container `deploy` command.

## Step 3: Build and push the image

```bash
gcloud builds submit \
  <APP_DIR> \
  --tag <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>/<REPOSITORY>/my-temporal-worker:build-1 \
  --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>
```

Tag the image with the build ID. It keeps image, pool, and Worker Deployment Version aligned, which matters because the compute configuration cannot pin a revision (→ `constraints.md`).

Record the immutable digest after the build:

```bash
gcloud artifacts docker images describe \
  <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>/<REPOSITORY>/my-temporal-worker:build-1 \
  --format='value(image_summary.digest)'
```

Deploy the recorded digest rather than the mutable tag so a later tag update cannot change what the pool runs.

Confirm the image targets the platform Cloud Run runs, `linux/amd64`, before deploying it. With Docker available, inspect the digest rather than the tag; on a multi-platform index the same format prints one entry per platform instead of a single value:

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev   # once, if Docker is not yet authorized for this registry
docker buildx imagetools inspect \
  <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>/<REPOSITORY>/my-temporal-worker@sha256:<DIGEST> \
  --format '{{.Image.OS}}/{{.Image.Architecture}}'
```

Expect exactly `linux/amd64`. `gcloud auth configure-docker` edits the user's Docker configuration, so mention it in the approval list if it has not been run before. A platform mismatch surfaces only when the instance starts, as a container that never logs.

The happy path deliberately uses Cloud Build's global endpoint. Supplying `--region` can require additional regional build and staging-bucket setup, depending on the project's Cloud Build bucket policy. If regional builds are required for a private pool or data-residency policy, pre-create or select the regional source/log buckets, grant the build identity access, and then add `--region <REGION>`.

## Step 4: Create the Worker Pool

**Create one pool per Worker Deployment Version, initially at zero instances.**

**Deploy only after the secret has an `ENABLED` version:**

```bash
gcloud secrets versions list <SECRET_NAME> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> --filter='state:ENABLED'
```

Deploying earlier fails with `secret_key_ref… versions/latest was not found`, even at zero instances, and still creates the pool with a revision that never becomes Ready (`SecretsAccessCheckFailed`). If that happens, add the version and re-run the same deploy command; this is safe while no Worker Deployment Version points at the pool.

```bash
gcloud run worker-pools deploy my-temporal-worker-pool-build-1 \
  --image <REGION>-docker.pkg.dev/<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>/<REPOSITORY>/my-temporal-worker@sha256:<DIGEST> \
  --region <REGION> \
  --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> \
  --service-account <RUNNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT> \
  --instances 0 \
  --set-env-vars TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=<ENDPOINT>,TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE=<NAMESPACE>,TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE=my-task-queue,TEMPORAL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=my-app,TEMPORAL_BUILD_ID=build-1 \
  --set-secrets TEMPORAL_API_KEY=<SECRET_NAME>:latest
```

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `--image` | The digest recorded after Step 3. |
| `--service-account` | The **runner** service account instances run as. **Not** the invoker Temporal impersonates. → `iam.md`. |
| `--instances` | Set to `0`; the WCI takes ownership of the count when the Worker Deployment Version is registered. |
| `--set-env-vars` | Non-secret configuration. |
| `--set-secrets` | Maps a Secret Manager secret to an env var — use it for `TEMPORAL_API_KEY` or TLS material. |
| `--memory` | Optional. Instance memory; pools default to 512 MiB. Raise it for Workers that need more, such as JVM Workers with large heaps. |

**Put the API key in Secret Manager from the start.** Do not introduce a plaintext environment-variable deployment step.

Wait for Cloud Run to report the pool ready and record the ready revision:

```bash
gcloud run worker-pools describe my-temporal-worker-pool-build-1 \
  --region <REGION> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> \
  --format='yaml(status.conditions,status.latestReadyRevisionName)'

gcloud run worker-pools revisions describe <LATEST_READY_REVISION> \
  --region <REGION> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> \
  --format='yaml(status.imageDigest)'
```

Require the `Ready` condition to be true and the revision digest to match the recorded image digest. A pool can be Ready at zero instances without ever starting the image; registration is the first runtime test.

## Step 5: Grant Temporal permission to scale the pool

Cloud Run has no invocation grant. Temporal **impersonates an invoker service account** and drives the Cloud Run admin API. Create it with Temporal's Terraform module — the Cloud UI supplies a filled-in template under **Workers → Create Worker Deployment → Access**. → `iam.md` for the module, its variables, and the two-service-account distinction.

Terraform's `invoker_email` output is what Step 6 needs.

**Wait for IAM propagation before Step 6.** The module's `serviceAccountTokenCreator` grants take time to reach Temporal's impersonation path. A `create-version` issued before they propagate is rejected with a 403 on `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken`. Rely on the read-back in Step 6 rather than on the clock; on that rejection, wait a few minutes, then retry once. → `iam.md`.

## Step 6: Register the Worker Deployment Version

```bash
temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment create --namespace <NS> --name my-app

temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment create-version \
  --namespace <NS> \
  --deployment-name my-app \
  --build-id build-1 \
  --gcp-cloud-run-project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> \
  --gcp-cloud-run-region <REGION> \
  --gcp-cloud-run-worker-pool my-temporal-worker-pool-build-1 \
  --gcp-cloud-run-service-account <INVOKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT> \
  --gcp-cloud-run-min-instances 0 \
  --gcp-cloud-run-max-instances 30 \
  --gcp-cloud-run-initial-instances 0 \
  --gcp-cloud-run-utilization-target 0.8 \
  --gcp-cloud-run-scale-down-stabilization-duration 90s
```

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--deployment-name` / `--build-id` | Must match the Worker code exactly. |
| `--gcp-cloud-run-project` | Project containing the pool. |
| `--gcp-cloud-run-region` | Pool region. |
| `--gcp-cloud-run-worker-pool` | Pool name from Step 4. |
| `--gcp-cloud-run-service-account` | The **invoker** — Terraform's `invoker_email`. |
| `--gcp-cloud-run-min-instances` | Floor the scaler maintains; `0` allows scale-to-zero. |
| `--gcp-cloud-run-max-instances` | Ceiling the scaler may request; defaults to `30`. |
| `--gcp-cloud-run-initial-instances` | Initial planned count; must be between min and max. |
| `--gcp-cloud-run-utilization-target` | Target average utilization in `(0, 1]`; defaults to `0.8`. |
| `--gcp-cloud-run-scale-down-stabilization-duration` | How long the scaler waits after the most recent sync match failure before scaling in; defaults to `90s`. Set it to `0s` to disable the wait. |

The accepted scaler group depends on the installed CLI. **Read `temporal worker deployment create-version --help` before constructing the command. This is the canonical compatibility guidance for scaler flags:**

- CLI v1.8.2 accepts four coupled flags: minimum, maximum, initial, and utilization target. Remove `--gcp-cloud-run-scale-down-stabilization-duration` from the example above.
- CLI v1.8.3 and later accept all five flags shown above.
- On either version, omit the whole supported group to accept the defaults (`0`, `30`, `0`, `0.8`, and a server-side `90s` stabilization duration).

Supplying only part of the supported group fails CLI validation. On an existing version, omitting the scaler flags leaves its current settings unchanged.

### Confirm the version was created

Do not truncate `create-version` output; its error is the only record of a rejected create. Then read the version back immediately:

```bash
temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment describe-version \
  --namespace <NS> --deployment-name my-app --build-id build-1
```

If it reports the version as not found, **the create was rejected**, even if the command appeared to succeed. During IAM propagation the rejection can read `worker pool … not found` although the pool name is correct, because the WCI's `ValidateSpec` failed with a 403 on `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken`. Read the `ValidateSpec` result in the WCI history (`../wci.md`) before changing any names. → [`diagnostics.md`](diagnostics.md#start-here-did-the-expected-worker-bind).

Through the UI, the version is set current automatically; through the CLI it is a separate step.

### Checkpoint: verify registration

Creating the Worker Deployment Version starts its WCI, which temporarily raises the pool to at least one instance so the Worker can bind its Task Queues. This occurs even when the minimum and initial instance counts are `0`. Wait for the expected Task Queue types before setting the version current. The separate UI **Validate Connection** action checks pool read access only and is not a substitute for this registration check. <!-- docs/production-deployment/worker-deployments/serverless-workers/cloud-run/index.mdx:824-827 -->

First run the machine-checkable [Task Queue binding check](diagnostics.md#start-here-did-the-expected-worker-bind). Do not continue until it finds the expected Task Queue and types. Then verify that Temporal wrote to the pool:

```bash
gcloud run worker-pools describe my-temporal-worker-pool-build-1 \
  --region <REGION> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> --format=yaml
```

In the pool's `metadata.annotations`, `serving.knative.dev/lastModifier` should show the invoker service account after the WCI updates the pool. That proves only that Temporal wrote the requested pool size; it does not prove that the intended image started or that the Worker bound the Task Queue. Confirm the pool's deployed digest and a Worker startup log that announces the expected deployment name, build ID, and Task Queue. → `diagnostics.md`.

## Step 7: Set the version current

```bash
temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment set-current-version \
  --namespace <NS> --deployment-name my-app --build-id build-1 --yes
```

Without this, new traffic does not route to the version. The registration instance may already have started and bound the Task Queue, but that bootstrap does not make the version current. The command prompts for confirmation. **When run non-interactively without `--yes`, it exits having changed nothing**, which reads as success. Read the state back:

```bash
temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment describe \
  --namespace <NS> --name my-app -o json \
  | jq -e '.routingConfig.currentVersionDeploymentName == "my-app"
           and .routingConfig.currentVersionBuildID == "build-1"'
```

CLI v1.8.2 reports the current version under these field names.

## Step 8: Verify

```bash
temporal --profile <PROFILE> workflow execute \
  --namespace <NS> --task-queue my-task-queue \
  --workflow-id my-app-verify-1 \
  --type <WORKFLOW_TYPE> --input '"Temporal"'
```

Start the Workflow type the deployed Worker registers, with an input it accepts. The SDK guides' samples register `MyWorkflow` (Go, Python), `myWorkflow` (TypeScript), or `GreetingWorkflow` (Java, .NET); each takes one string and returns `Hello, <name>!`, so expect `"Hello, Temporal!"`. If the user deploys their own Worker or another sample, read its Worker source or registration for the type, input shape, and expected result, and set `--type` and `--input` to match. `workflow execute` waits for the result; if it has not returned within a few minutes, stop waiting (the Workflow keeps running; inspect its history) and follow `diagnostics.md`.

Tasks arriving with no active pollers cause the WCI to raise the instance count; Cloud Run starts an instance, the Worker connects and processes the Task.

The scaler minimum is `0`, and the pool normally returns to zero within a few minutes after registration or work completes. Do not wait for scale-to-zero during normal verification: the Workflow above verifies routing and execution, but registration scale-down can race it, so do not classify that run as reliably warm or cold.

Test scale-from-zero only when the user explicitly asks for a cold-path test. It adds several minutes per run. Wait until the requested count is zero and the logs show the previous instance received `SIGTERM`, then start a second Workflow and measure until the Worker startup/polling log appears.

Confirm from two independent signals:

- **Temporal** — Task completions in the Workflow's event history.
- **Cloud Run** — pool logs showing Worker startup and Task processing, read with the [pool log query](diagnostics.md#read-the-pool-logs). **A scaled-to-zero pool emits no new logs.**

## Rotate the Temporal API keys

Rotate each key on its own schedule; that is why the Worker and the operator hold separate keys. Temporal Cloud accepts several unexpired keys per owner at once, so rotate by overlap: create the new key, switch its consumer to it, confirm the consumer works, then disable and later delete the old key. Never revoke the old key first. The user creates every new key in their own terminal or the Cloud UI, as in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). Disabling or deleting a key is a mutation that needs the user's approval: `tcld apikey disable --id <KEY_ID>` and `tcld apikey delete --id <KEY_ID>`, preceded by the global `tcld --auto_confirm` when run non-interactively. `tcld apikey list --owner-id <OWNER_ID> --owner-type <user|service-account>` lists an owner's keys by ID; find a user's ID with `tcld user get --user-email <EMAIL>` and a service account's with `tcld service-account list`. A disabled key can be re-enabled with `tcld apikey enable --id <KEY_ID>`; a deleted one cannot. Give each new key an expiry later than its rotation date, so a delayed rotation does not become an outage: `--duration` takes values such as `30d`, `4d12h`, or `1.5y`, and `--expiry` takes an RFC 3339 timestamp. <!-- https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/api-keys -->

### The Worker's key

**Cloud Run reads a secret in an environment variable when each instance starts.** A new secret version therefore reaches only instances that start after it is added; a running instance keeps the key it started with. A pool at zero instances needs no action, because its next instance reads the newest version. SDK key suppliers do not change this: the environment variable they read was fixed when the instance started. <!-- https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/workerpools/secrets -->

1. **List every pool that mounts the secret**, not only this deployment's, repeating for each region the project deploys pools in. Every pool it prints is affected by this rotation:
   ```bash
   gcloud run worker-pools list --region <REGION> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> --format=json \
     | jq -r --arg s '<SECRET_NAME>' '.[]
         | select([.. | objects | .secretKeyRef? // empty | (.name // .secret // "")]
                  | any(. == $s or endswith("/secrets/" + $s)))
         | .metadata.name // .name'
   ```
   If a listed pool belongs to another deployment, tell the user before continuing.
2. **The user creates the new key** for the same owner as the old one, then runs the [Worker hand-off](#hand-off-the-temporal-api-keys) again, which adds a new secret version. Confirm with `gcloud secrets versions list` that the newest version is `ENABLED`.
3. **Keep the old key enabled until no listed pool runs an instance that started before the new version.** Read each pool's requested count, `run.googleapis.com/manualInstanceCount`, as in [Read the pool's annotations](diagnostics.md#read-the-pools-annotations). Once a pool's count reads `0` after the new version was added, every later instance starts with the new key. For a pool that stays above zero, ask the user how and when its instances may be restarted; do not redeploy a new build into a pool that serves a live version (`versioning.md`).
4. **Disable the old key**, with approval. Then start a Workflow on this deployment's Task Queue and confirm it completes, and check every listed pool's logs for authentication errors with the [pool log query](diagnostics.md#read-the-pool-logs). If something fails, re-enable the old key and return to step 3.
5. **Delete the old key** once the disabled key has caused no failures. Then disable the secret versions older than the newest with `gcloud secrets versions disable <VERSION> --secret <SECRET_NAME> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>`. **Never disable the newest version:** the pools reference `:latest`, so new instances read it. Disabling an old version only stops new reads of it; revoking the key in Temporal Cloud is what ends its use.

### The operator's key

When only the operator's CLI profile holds this key, no pool is affected. If the same key is also stored in a secret, for example from the personal-test path or an earlier single-key hand-off, separate them first: give the operator a new key of their own with steps 1 and 2 below, then rotate the old key as [the Worker's key](#the-workers-key). Skip step 3 below: pools still use the old key, and the Worker-key rotation retires it.

1. The user creates the new key and runs the [operator hand-off](#hand-off-the-temporal-api-keys) again, which overwrites the profile's key.
2. Confirm the profile authenticates with `temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment list --namespace <NAMESPACE>`.
3. Disable the old key, with approval, and delete it once nothing has failed with it disabled.

## Teardown

Record what you create as you go: project and region; the Artifact Registry repository, image tag and digest; the pool name; the runner and invoker service accounts, and whether this run created each; whether this run added the runner's secret-access binding; the Terraform state directory; the secret and its versions, and whether it is shared; the deployment name, build ID, and Task Queue; the local CLI profile name, and whether this run wrote it; and, for each Temporal API key, who created it, which user or service account owns it, and whether it is the Worker's, the operator's, or both.

Scale the pool to zero before deleting the version so its pollers stop without destroying the pool prematurely.

1. Unset the current version — a Current version cannot be deleted:
   ```bash
   temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment set-current-version \
     --namespace <NS> --deployment-name my-app --unversioned --yes
   ```
2. Scale the pool to zero, which ends polling:
   ```bash
   gcloud run worker-pools update <POOL_NAME> --instances 0 --region <REGION> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>
   ```
3. Delete the version once it has no pollers and is not draining, then delete the deployment. Scaled-down instances keep polling briefly, and `delete-version` refuses a draining version; while it drains, the command returns `cannot be deleted since it is draining`. Retry rather than adding `--skip-drainage`:
   ```bash
   temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment describe-version \
     --namespace <NS> --deployment-name my-app --build-id build-1 -o json \
     | jq -r '.drainageInfo.drainageStatus // empty'
   for i in $(seq 1 12); do
     temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment delete-version \
       --namespace <NS> --deployment-name my-app --build-id build-1 && break
     sleep 30
   done
   temporal --profile <PROFILE> worker deployment delete --namespace <NS> --name my-app
   ```
4. Delete the Worker Pool:
   ```bash
   gcloud run worker-pools delete <POOL_NAME> --region <REGION> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>
   ```
5. `terraform destroy` the IAM module — **only if this deployment created it.** One invoker service account can serve several pools, so a shared one may still be in use. → `iam.md`.
6. Decide the runner and its secret access from the inventory, after step 4 has deleted this deployment's pool. First list the Worker Pools that still run as the runner, repeating for each region the project deploys pools in:
   ```bash
   gcloud run worker-pools list --region <REGION> --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> --format=json \
     | jq -r '.[] | select((.spec.template.spec.serviceAccountName // .template.serviceAccount) == "<RUNNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>@<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>.iam.gserviceaccount.com")
              | .metadata.name // .name'
   ```
   Then act only on the branch that matches:
   - **Any pool is listed:** keep both the runner's secret binding and the runner, and skip the rest of this step.
   - **No pool is listed and the inventory records that this run added the binding:** remove it.
     ```bash
     gcloud secrets remove-iam-policy-binding <SECRET_NAME> \
       --member="serviceAccount:<RUNNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>@<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>
     ```
   - **No pool is listed and the inventory records that this run created the runner:** delete it, after removing its binding above.
     ```bash
     gcloud iam service-accounts delete \
       <RUNNER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>@<YOUR_GCP_PROJECT>.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
       --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> --quiet
     ```

   Keep any binding or runner the inventory does not attribute to this run.
7. Delete the container image from Artifact Registry, and any Secret Manager secret this run created that no other deployment uses; keep a reused or shared secret. Delete the Artifact Registry repository too if this run created it. Ask before revoking either Temporal Cloud API key: a key is account-scoped, not deployment-scoped, and the Worker's key may also be mounted by another pool. List those pools with step 1 of [Rotate the Temporal API keys](#rotate-the-temporal-api-keys) first. Once nothing else uses the local CLI profile, and only if this run wrote it, remove it with `temporal config delete-profile --profile <PROFILE>`.

Confirm each deletion with a list command rather than `describe`: a recently deleted service account can return `PERMISSION_DENIED` from `describe` instead of `NOT_FOUND`. For example, `gcloud iam service-accounts list --project <YOUR_GCP_PROJECT> --filter='email:<EMAIL>' --format='value(email)'` prints nothing once the account is gone.
